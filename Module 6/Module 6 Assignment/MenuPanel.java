     * Add a Menu bar
     * [File -> Exit], [Help -> About]
     *      [About] -> Opens JDialog
     *          The About menu item will bring up an About window (JDialog). You can create another class for this. The About window will have the following:
                    A label for your name
                    A label for the name of the class (CIT 272 - Object Oriented Programming and Data Structuers)
                    A label for a short description of the program
                    An "OK" button that dismisses the Dialog window (sets its Visibility to false).
